# UFOs

## Overview 

In this module I used Javascript, a front end development language, to help Dana to build a dynamic website which has information about Unidentified Flying Object or UFOs for short. This page contains a table and filters to help us to find certain information according to the data provided by the user.

This website was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript, this combination allowed us to give the desired format and specifications to the website, and also to filter the search of the user based on the date, city, state, country and shape of the sigthing.

## Results

### Appereance
Once the website was finished the looks are shown in the figure below, the main page shows a short discussion about the existence or not of UFOs and also shows, at firts, a table with the complete information of different sightings that could be filtered according to the needs of the user.

### Use of the site
Once the table is displayed we can filter the search in five topics date, city, state, country and shape. The filters are applied once the user press enter and the filters could be applied once or multiple at the time. The filters criteria is shown in the figure below.

Figure 2. Filter criteria

In the Figure below we can se the filters in use. The date, city and state filters are applied and we can see that the table is shortened to only 2 rows.

## Summary 
In general terms, the web page has a mian drawback which is the lack of the use of a button. In my opinion, the button allows the user to give the command to the site when the information is complete and when the table should be filtered.

Furthermore, two points that should be adressed in a future redesign should be the inclusion of more images or examples for each row in the table, and also the colors of the webpage should be improved to allow the user a better capacity of reading and understanding.
